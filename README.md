# FinanceFlow Website

## Description

This multi-page website is a template designed for finance startups. It marks my first project after almost a year since I last worked on HTML and CSS. The motivation to embark on this project came from [BOLARINWA](https://github.com/TLTechbender),who also built the same website, you can check it out [here](https://ysf-flow.netlify.app/), He motivated me to improve my coding skills. Creating this website allowed me to brush up on my coding abilities, and I have been learning something new every day throughout its development. Below, I will share the valuable insights and lessons I gained during the process

# Design

## Lesson learnt

- I understood scope better during this project
- I practiced destructuring as much as I can during the project
- I was able to dynamically upload content onto the page from my .JSON file
- I used asynchronous function to fectch data from the .JSON and render it to the page
- The pages i learnt the most are the blog page and the token page

## Contributing

- Contribute code: The website is not pixel perfect, There are a lot of places where the websites doesn't look like the design, feel free to contribute and make changes to the website
